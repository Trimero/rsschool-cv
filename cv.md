I am 30 years old. I want to become a front end developer.Graduated from the GSU with a degree in IT engineering and never worked in his specialty. Ready to discover something new.

---

I studied Java for about 3 months and nothing worked. Now I have been studying Front end for more than 3 months, and I can write a website with the simplest functionality.

```function burgerOpen() {
        document.body.style.overflowX = "hidden";
        close_bg.classList.toggle("active")
        close_burger.classList.toggle("active")
        burger.classList.toggle("active")
    }
```

Haven't worked in IT yet...

In 2015 graduated from Gomel State University named after Francysk Skaryna.
